# Hand Written Digit CLassification in Machine Learning

Implement a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and evaluate its performance in classifying handwritten digits.
1. Feed Forward Propagation
2. Back Propagation
3. Regularisation in Neural Network

Tensor Flow Library:  implement a single layer Neural Network and infer that implementing multiple layers can be a very cumbersome coding task. However, additional layers can provide a better modeling of the data set. The analysis of the challenging CelebA data set will show how adding more layers can improve the performance of the Neural Network.
